### To avoid logging off and back in after adding your account to the local **Administrators** group on a Windows 10/11 machine, the most effective methods are:  

### **1. Restarting the Explorer Process**  
Killing and restarting **explorer.exe** refreshes the user session, which may apply new group memberships without a full logoff:  
```powershell  
Stop-Process -Name explorer -Force  
Start-Process explorer  
```
This method is less reliable than a full logoff but may work for some scenarios.  

### **2. Using `RunAs` to Spawn a New Session**  
If you need immediate admin rights, launch a new process with elevated privileges:  
```powershell  
runas /user:YourUsername cmd  
```
This creates a new session with updated permissions.  

### **3. Forcing a Token Refresh (Limited Use)**  
While **`klist purge`** clears Kerberos tickets, it **does not** update local group memberships. Instead, use:  
```powershell  
whoami /groups  
```
to verify group changes, but note that a new token (via logoff/login) is required for full effect.  

### **Key Limitation**  
Windows **does not** dynamically update the access token for an active session. The only guaranteed way to fully apply local admin rights is to log off and back on.

For scripting, use:  
```powershell  
Add-LocalGroupMember -Group "Administrators" -Member "DOMAIN\Username"  
```
forced logoff if automation is acceptable
