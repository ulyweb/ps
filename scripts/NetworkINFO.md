Force both Ethernet and Wi-Fi interfaces to be up simultaneously in Windows 10 or 11. Here's how you can achieve this:

1. Open the Control Panel and navigate to "Network and Internet" > "Network and Sharing Center" > "Change adapter settings"[6].

2. Right-click on both your Ethernet and Wi-Fi adapters and select "Enable" for each if they are not already enabled[6].

3. To ensure both interfaces remain active, you need to modify a Group Policy setting:

   a. Press Windows key + R, type "gpedit.msc", and press Enter to open the Local Group Policy Editor.
   b. Navigate to: Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Network > Windows Connection Manager.
   c. Double-click on "Minimize the number of simultaneous connections to the Internet or a Windows Domain".
   d. Select "Enabled" and set the "Minimize Policy Options" to "0 = Allow all simultaneous connections"[1].

4. Click "Apply" and "OK" to save the changes.

5. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

After following these steps, both your Ethernet and Wi-Fi interfaces should remain active simultaneously. You can verify this by checking the Network Connections window or by using the command prompt and typing "ipconfig /all" to see the status of all network adapters.

Keep in mind that while both interfaces can be active, Windows will typically prioritize one connection over the other for internet traffic. If you want to control which interface is used for specific tasks, you may need to adjust the interface metrics or set up specific routes.


I apologize for the confusion. You're right that the GUI steps may not be accurate for Windows 11. Let's use PowerShell commands instead to enable both Ethernet and Wi-Fi interfaces simultaneously and keep them active. Here's a PowerShell script to achieve this:

```powershell
# Enable both Ethernet and Wi-Fi adapters
Enable-NetAdapter -Name "Ethernet" -Confirm:$false
Enable-NetAdapter -Name "Wi-Fi" -Confirm:$false

# Set interface metrics to prioritize Ethernet over Wi-Fi
Set-NetIPInterface -InterfaceAlias "Ethernet" -InterfaceMetric 10
Set-NetIPInterface -InterfaceAlias "Wi-Fi" -InterfaceMetric 20

# Restart both adapters to apply changes
Restart-NetAdapter -Name "Ethernet"
Restart-NetAdapter -Name "Wi-Fi"

# Display the status of the adapters
Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object {$_.Name -in ("Ethernet", "Wi-Fi")} | Format-Table Name, Status, LinkSpeed
```

This script does the following:

1. Enables both Ethernet and Wi-Fi adapters.
2. Sets a lower interface metric for Ethernet (10) to prioritize it over Wi-Fi (20).
3. Restarts both adapters to apply the changes.
4. Displays the status of both adapters.

To run this script:

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.
2. Copy and paste the entire script into the PowerShell window.
3. Press Enter to execute the script.

This approach should work on Windows 11 and will keep both interfaces active while prioritizing Ethernet for network traffic[1][2]. If you need to adjust the adapter names, you can use `Get-NetAdapter` to list all available adapters and their names before running the script.
